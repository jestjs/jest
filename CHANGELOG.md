## 0.7.0

- Fixed a memory leak with test contexts. Jest now properly cleans up test environments after each test. Added `--logHeapUsage` to log memory usage after each test. Note: this is option is meant for debugging memory leaks and might significantly slow down your test run.
- Removed `mock-modules`, `node-haste` and `mocks` virtual modules. This is a breaking change of undocumented public API. Usage of this API can safely be automatically updated through an automated codemod:
- Example: <http://astexplorer.net/#/zrybZ6UvRA>

- jscodeshift: <https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift>

- Updated jsdom to 7.0.2.
- Use the current working directory as root when passing a jest config from the command line.

## 0.6.0

- jest now reports the number of tests that were run instead of the number of test files.
- Added a `--json` option to print test results as JSON.
- Changed the preprocessor API. A preprocessor now receives the script, file and config. The cache key function receives the script, file and stringified config to be able to create consistent hashes.

- Allow to specify a custom `testRunner` in the configuration (#531).
- Added a `--no-cache` option to make it easier to debug preprocessor scripts.
- Fix code coverage on windows (#499).
