## Getting Started

<!-- copied from Getting Started docs, links updated to point to Jest website -->

Install Jest using [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/jest):

```bash
yarn add --dev jest
```

Or [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest):

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
```

Note: Jest documentation uses `yarn` commands, but `npm` will also work. You can compare `yarn` and `npm` commands in the [yarn docs, here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/migrating-from-npm#toc-cli-commands-comparison).

Let's get started by writing a test for a hypothetical function that adds two numbers. First, create a `sum.js` file:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
module.exports = sum;
```

Then, create a file named `sum.test.js`. This will contain our actual test:

```javascript
const sum = require('./sum');

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
```

Add the following section to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```

Finally, run `yarn test` or `npm test` and Jest will print this message:

```bash
PASS  ./sum.test.js
✓ adds 1 + 2 to equal 3 (5ms)
```

**You just successfully wrote your first test using Jest!**

This test used `expect` and `toBe` to test that two values were exactly identical. To learn about the other things that Jest can test, see [Using Matchers](https://jestjs.io/docs/using-matchers).

## Running from command line

You can run Jest directly from the CLI (if it's globally available in your `PATH`, e.g. by `yarn global add jest` or `npm install jest --global`) with a variety of useful options.

Here's how to run Jest on files matching `my-test`, using `config.json` as a configuration file and display a native OS notification after the run:

```bash
jest my-test --notify --config=config.json
```

If you'd like to learn more about running `jest` through the command line, take a look at the [Jest CLI Options](https://jestjs.io/docs/cli) page.

## Additional Configuration

### Generate a basic configuration file

Based on your project, Jest will ask you a few questions and will create a basic configuration file with a short description for each option:

```bash
yarn create jest
```

### Using Babel

To use [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), install required dependencies via `yarn`:

```bash
yarn add --dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env
```

Configure Babel to target your current version of Node by creating a `babel.config.js` file in the root of your project:

```javascript
// babel.config.js
module.exports = {
  presets: [['@babel/preset-env', {targets: {node: 'current'}}]],
};
```

The ideal configuration for Babel will depend on your project. See [Babel's docs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/) for more details.

<details>
  <summary markdown="span"><strong>Making your Babel config jest-aware</strong></summary>

Jest will set `process.env.NODE_ENV` to `'test'` if it's not set to something else. You can use that in your configuration to conditionally setup only the compilation needed for Jest, e.g.

```javascript
// babel.config.js
module.exports = api => {
  const isTest = api.env('test');
  // You can use isTest to determine what presets and plugins to use.

  return {
    // ...
  };
};
```

> Note: `babel-jest` is automatically installed when installing Jest and will automatically transform files if a babel configuration exists in your project. To avoid this behavior, you can explicitly reset the `transform` configuration option:

```javascript
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  transform: {},
};
```

</details>

<!-- Note that the Babel 6 section in the Getting Started was removed -->

### Using webpack

Jest can be used in projects that use [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to manage assets, styles, and compilation. webpack does offer some unique challenges over other tools. Refer to the [webpack guide](https://jestjs.io/docs/webpack) to get started.

### Using Vite

Jest can be used in projects that use [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to serves source code over native ESM to provide some frontend tooling, vite is an opinionated tool and does offer some out-of-the box workflows. Jest is not fully supported by vite due to how the [plugin system](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/1955#issuecomment-776009094) from vite works, but there is some working examples for first-class jest integration using the `vite-jest`, since this is not fully supported, you might as well read the [limitation of the `vite-jest`](https://github.com/sodatea/vite-jest/tree/main/packages/vite-jest#limitations-and-differences-with-commonjs-tests). Refer to the [vite guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) to get started.

### Using Parcel

Jest can be used in projects that use [parcel-bundler](https://parceljs.org/) to manage assets, styles, and compilation similar to webpack. Parcel requires zero configuration. Refer to the official [docs](https://parceljs.org/docs/) to get started.

### Using TypeScript

Jest supports TypeScript, via Babel. First, make sure you followed the instructions on [using Babel](#using-babel) above. Next, install the `@babel/preset-typescript` via `yarn`:

```bash
yarn add --dev @babel/preset-typescript
```

Then add `@babel/preset-typescript` to the list of presets in your `babel.config.js`.

```diff
// babel.config.js
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    ['@babel/preset-env', {targets: {node: 'current'}}],
+    '@babel/preset-typescript',
  ],
};
```

However, there are some [caveats](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-typescript#caveats) to using TypeScript with Babel. Because TypeScript support in Babel is purely transpilation, Jest will not type-check your tests as they are run. If you want that, you can use [ts-jest](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest) instead, or just run the TypeScript compiler [tsc](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html) separately (or as part of your build process).
