# jest-editor-support

The engine that allows editors to build on top of Jest.

## Usage

This is only useful if you are interested in building an editor integration for Jest.

For now as an end user, I'd recommend looking at Orta's [vscode-jest](https://github.com/orta/vscode-jest/).

## Note
Since version `18.2.0` TypeScript is now a peer dependency.
If you don't need to handle `.tsx` files then you can safely ignore the warning during installation.
