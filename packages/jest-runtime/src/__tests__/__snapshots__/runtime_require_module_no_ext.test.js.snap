exports[`Runtime requireModule with no extension throws error pointing out file with extension 1`] = `
"Cannot find module 'RegularModuleWithWrongExt' from 'root.js'

However, Jest was able to find:
	'./RegularModuleWithWrongExt.txt'

You might want to include a file extension in your import, or update your 'moduleFileExtensions', which is currently ['js', 'jsx', 'ts', 'tsx', 'json', 'node'].

See https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#modulefileextensions-arraystring"
