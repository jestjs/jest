The community around Jest is working hard to make the testing experience even greater.

[jest-community](https://github.com/jest-community) is a new GitHub organization for high quality Jest additions curated by Jest maintainers and collaborators. It already features some of our favorite projects, to name a few:

- [vscode-jest](https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest)
- [jest-extended](https://github.com/jest-community/jest-extended)
- [eslint-plugin-jest](https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest)
- [awesome-jest](https://github.com/jest-community/awesome-jest)

Community projects under one organization are a great way for Jest to experiment with new ideas/techniques and approaches. Encourage contributions from the community and publish contributions independently at a faster pace.

## Awesome Jest

The jest-community org maintains an [awesome-jest](https://github.com/jest-community/awesome-jest) list of great projects and resources related to Jest.

If you have something awesome to share, feel free to reach out to us! We'd love to share your project on the awesome-jest list ([send a PR here](https://github.com/jest-community/awesome-jest/pulls)) or if you would like to transfer your project to the jest-community org reach out to one of the owners of the org.
