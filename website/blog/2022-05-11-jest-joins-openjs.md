Today we're excited to announce that Jest is joining the OpenJS Foundation!

This change transfers ownership of the project from Meta to the Jest Core team via the OpenJS Foundation as an Impact Project. We’re grateful to Meta for creating Jest and all of their support over the years, and we look forward to the future of Jest as a project owned by the Jest community!

Check out the [Meta Engineering blog](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2022/05/11/meta-open-source-transfers-jest-to-openjs-foundation/) and [OpenJS Foundation blog](https://openjsf.org/blog/2022/05/11/openjs-foundation-welcomes-jest/) announcements for more info.
