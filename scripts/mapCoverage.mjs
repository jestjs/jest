/**
 * Because we have a build step, sometimes we can test files from both
 * `packages/jest-whatever/build/*` and `packages/jest-whatever/src/*`
 *
 * If we require file by its relative path like:
 *    // inside `jest-whatever/src/__tests__/index.js`
 *    require('../index.js'); // this will require `jest-whatever/src/index.js`
 *
 * But if we require it by a package name, this will go through node_modules
 * and lerna index.js link. So the actual file will be required from `build/`
 *    // inside another packages
 *    // this will go through lerna and require `jest-whatever/build/index.js
 *    require('jest-whatever')
 *
 * these files are identical (one is preprocessed, another is transformed on
 * the fly), but the coverage paths are different.
 * This script will map coverage results from both locations to one and
 * produce a full coverage report.
